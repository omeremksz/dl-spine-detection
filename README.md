# A Deep Learning Model for Scoliosis and Spondylolisthesis Detection

**Description:**
This project presents a deep learning model for the detection of spinal abnormalities, specifically targeting scoliosis and spondylolisthesis. The model utilizes the GoogLeNet pre-trained network architecture. Evaluation of the model's performance is based on various metrics, including F1 score, precision, recall, and specificity. Curves for training, validation, and test sets are also examined.

**Dataset:**
The dataset included 338 subjects, comprising 240 females and 98 males. It consists of X-ray images of the vertebral column. You can access the dataset [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xkt857dsxk/1).

**Features:**
- Developed deep learning tool for spinal abnormality detection
- Utilizes GoogLeNet pre-trained network
- Performance metrics include F1 score, precision, recall, and specificity
- Curves analysis for training, validation, and test sets

**Model Sharing:**
The saved model is not included in this repository. However, you can train your own model using the googlenet_model.ipynb file provided.
